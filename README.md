<h1>Hi 👋🏽 I'm Kerstian, this is my SQL Portfolio!

<h4>Welcome to my SQL portfolio! Here you'll find a collection of SQL projects I've worked on that demonstrate my data manipulation, querying, and database management skills while using PostgreSQL. These projects showcase my experience :</h4>

  * Writing efficient and complex SQL queries
  * Creating and managing databases
  * Performing data analysis using SQL
  * Optimizing query performance
  * Leveraging SQL to solve real-world data problems  

<h2>👩🏽‍💻 SQL Projects:</h2>

- <b>SC Counties Population</b> [SQL](https://github.com/joshmadakor1/Algorithms-Practice) - In this project, I used data provided by the United State Census Bureau to analyze the population for the population of the counties throughout South Carolina from 2020 until 2023. I created a database in PostgreSQL and answered the following questions:

    1. What was the total population of South Carolina in in 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023?
    2. What was the average population per county in South Carolina in 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023?
    3. Which 3 counties experienced the most growth over the 4 year period?
    4. Which 3 counties experience the least growth over the 4 year period?
    5. What are the top 5 most populous counties in South Carolina?
    6. What is the total population by region?
 
    7.
