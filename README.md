<h1>Hi, I'm Kerstian, This is my SQL Portfolio!
Welcome to my SQL portfolio! Here, you'll find a collection of SQL projects I've worked on that demonstrate my data manipulation, querying, and database management skills while using PostgreSQL. These projects showcase my experience :

  Writing efficient and complex SQL queries
  Creating and managing databases
  Performing data analysis using SQL
  Optimizing query performance
  Working with relational databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, etc.)
  Leveraging SQL to solve real-world data problems
